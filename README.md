# **Ludo Board Game with Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  

## **Overview**  
This project is a digital implementation of the classic **Ludo board game**, enhanced with a **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** system to manage user access and permissions effectively. The integration of RBAC ensures a secure and user-friendly experience for players, moderators, and administrators.  

The project is designed as a multiplayer game where users can play Ludo, while administrators have control over managing user roles, permissions, and game settings via a dedicated dashboard.
